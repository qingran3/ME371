## Features
- **Load Capacity:** Designed to safely support and transport a person weighing up to 70 kg.
- **Planetary Gear Transmission:** Designed with three forward gears and one reverse gear, allowing the cart to move forward at three different speeds and efficiently operate in reverse.
- **Climbing Capability:** Capable of climbing an arched bridge with a rugged and uneven stone surface.
- **Load Analysis:** Evaluated the loads on all connection components, ensuring a safety factor exceeding 2 for reliable performance.
- **Optimized Design:** Conducted Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to minimize material usage while maintaining structural strength.
